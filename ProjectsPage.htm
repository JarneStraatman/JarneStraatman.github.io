<h1>Projects</h1>

<p>For my study as well as in my own time i have had some projects that i think are interesting to talk about.</p>


<h2>CreaTe module 2 project</h2>

<p>In module 2 of creative technology we had a project that was about life and light. Our group made a sculpture of an owl that would measure the several things regarding air
 quality. It measured the temperature, the humidity, volatile organic compounds and CO2. These values would be shown on a locally hosted webpage. The sculpture had led lights 
 inside that would gradually change color depending on the air quality. It was made with an ESP8266 chip with all nescessary sensors attached to it. It required both hardware 
 development and programming</p>

 <p>This image shows the end result, the sculpture casting a yellow light on the wall. The air quality dropped because someone had breathed on the sensor.</p>
 
 
 <h2>Create module 1 hackathon2</h2>
 
 <p>In module 1 of creative technology our group made a drink dispenser that could dispense 2 different types of drinks, one by pressing a button and one by clapping your hands.
 It was made with a breadboard and didn't need programming. It was really fun working on the layout of all the components to make the end product as compact as possible,
 without risking to damage the components with the water from the tanks.</p>

 <p>This video shows the end result. First a button is pressed and water is dispensed, then someone claps their hands and water from another tank gets dispensed.</p>
 
 <h3>Homemade computer</h3>
 
 <p>I have build my own computer, it required a lot of research to find out which components were compatible with eachother. After researching i ordered the parts and put them 
 together. I did have some problems with wiring but i compined two parts through one connector and that solved it.</p>

 <p>This is a photo taken during the process of making it. It was the first test if it would turn on.</p>
